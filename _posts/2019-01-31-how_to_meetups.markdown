Attending meetups is something that I've heard, as a student/software developer/someone in tech, you should be going to at all stages in your career. It is also something that terrified me. After finally biting the bullet, I have found these to be one of my favorite parts about breaking into tech world.

* ** Get Over the Intimidation** <br><br>
   It took me awhile to get over the actual thought of meeting new people in a new field. For awhile my mindset was that I was too new, I wouldn't have anything in common with anyone, or people would look at me differently, or less seriously, since I was doing a bootcamp. I had this idea that because I wasn't at (*insert arbitrary point in the curriculum here*), that I shouldn't go to meetups yet. I was wrong! I have been actively attending DCRUG (DC Ruby Users Group) meetups, and the people who I have met could not be more welcoming to beginners. The first step is really getting out of your own head about it. <br><br>
* ** Find Something that Interests You** <br><br>
   I found DCRUG because most of my experience with Flatiron has been with Ruby, and I genuinely love the language. Once a month, they have a Monthly Meetup and a Hack Night. My first meetup was the hack night, which just means bring your computer, work on projects, eat pizza and meet people! I felt like the pressure to network would be lower if everyone was working on their computers too. That night I got help on SQL queries, chatted about Ruby and met some awesome people (with casual networking on the side). <br><br>
	 The Montly Meetup is where someone from the industry does a presentation. These nights are definitely more networking oriented, but it is also inspiring and motivational to see projects and companies doing work that interests me and that I would also love to be a part of someday. It really opens your eyes to all of the possibilities that are available to you, once you are finished and begin the job hunt.<br><br>
* ** Networking** <br><br>
I've made some great connections at these events. I am still months away from finishing my program, but building a network is just as important as doing the labs and reading the lessons. Just showing up to meetups shows hiring mangers that you are self-driven, interested in expanding your knowledge and you become a familiar face. And honestly, I've met so many other Flatiron students, that my network now also includes them. They have become people who I have something in common with, and I wouldn't be afraid of reaching out to in the future for potential job opportunities. <br><br>
* ** Goals**<br><br>
I think the most exciting thing about meetups is that I have found projects that I want to pursue. In 2019, I have goals to participate in Ruby For Good and learn Python with Hear Me Code. <br><br>
Ruby For Good is an annual event in the DC area that brings together Ruby programmers, of all skill levels, from all over the world. They get together for a weekend to build projects that help the community. (More information can be found at https://rubyforgood.org/ .) I first learned about Ruby For Good at one of the Monthly Meetups I attended with DCRUG. It sounded like such an amazing experience, that I immediately knew that I wanted to be a part of it in 2019. <br><br>
My other goal is to learn an additional language, Python, through Hear Me Code. Hear Me Code provides free, beginner-level coding classes to women in the DC area while creating a safe and supportive environment to learn and grow together. Python is another widely used language, and I feel like I would benefit from learning it, so why not learn it surrounded by people just like me!<br><br>
Meetups have honestly had such an impact on my learning experience, that I am so thankful I decided to put myself out there and start attending them.
