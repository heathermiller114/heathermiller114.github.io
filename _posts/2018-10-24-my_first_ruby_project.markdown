I feel such a relief as I am putting the finishing touches on my CLI Data Gem Project. I definitely approached this project in *not the most effective* way, and learned a lot from that. I watched the introductory and code-along videos, and then I just tried jumping right in. In hindsight, I would prepare myself a lot differently. 

**Pseudocode is your friend.**

I frequently became frustrated when my code would not do what I thought I needed it to do. I would scramble and make a lot of changes in different places and keep running my code and getting errors, instead of thinking from start to finish what I needed my specific code to achieve. Next time, I want to originally write out what I want my code to do, instead of just trying to jump right in and get frustrated with silly errors. 

**Pry is a GOD.**

Debugging using pry is something that I used more as I worked through my project, but wish I had utilized it in the initial stages. Figuring out what your code is returning or scraping or where it's breaking is invaluable and essential. In the beginning, I would get errors and just try to figure it out and change things in multiple places based upon the error message, but using pry additionally helps you genuinely figure out *why* the code is doing what it's doing and helps build knowledge of how the code is working (or, more likely, not). 

**GIT PUSH OFTEN.**

I feel like everything I read online includes this, but it isn't until you lose an hour and a half of work that you truly understand it. 

**Ask for help.**

I tend to want to figure things out on my own, but I can easily become my own worst enemy.  Yes, this entire process is primarily us teaching these new things to ourselves, but there is also a vast community of people that are willing to help. I was definitely wary about reaching out, but the support I received from other students and staff was unbeliveable and extremely helpful. We learn as a community. I spent *hours* trying to tell my code to limit how many items it scraped from my site, and became frustrated when everything I tried ended up with an error. It took less than 10 minutes in a debugging help session for me to learn that limiting the number of what the user ends up seeing is much easier than trying to limit what my code scrapes. (Actually, he told me that limiting what I scrape wasn't even possible, haha) 


My project uses the programming blog website Dev.To. It welcomes the user, and then shows the top 20 topic hashtags, which the authors on the site use to easily describe what their post is about. The user is prompted to select a topic hashtag that interests them, and once the selection is made, the most recent eight articles that tagged that specific topic hashtag in their post shows, with any additional hashtags, and the URL for the user to read the entire article online. It's a quick way for a user to see any new posts for programming topics that they enjoy!
