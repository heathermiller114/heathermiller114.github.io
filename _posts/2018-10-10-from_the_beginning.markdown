I had it all figured out. I went to Penn State University, and graduated in 2015 with a degree in Forensic Chemistry and a minor in Chemistry. I would move to the DC area, find a job, work my tail off in a field I loved and everything would be perfect. However, that all quickly derailed. I failed to find a job in my field and I panicked the longer I was without full-time work in the field I had originally fallen in love with. 

At the time, I was working part-time in retail, and through some connections, I was offered a full-time position as a Retail Manager. Sure, it wasn't what I originally aspired to, but it would pay the bills while I continued to try to pursue a "real" job. 

Retail has a way of sucking you in, and stealing your soul (not literally, but almost). As time went by, I lost any and all aspirations to find a job in Chemistry. My friends who had luck finding jobs all hated their lives, so was I really in a different boat from any of them? Every time we would talk about our time in college, we would always talk about what we would choose to major in, if we could choose all over again. I often talked about how I thought a degree in Computer Science or Engineering would have been a better fit, and they would talk about how anything would be better than being isolated at a lab bench like they currently were. 

I began to think about how I could pivot. I knew I didn't want to make a career out of retail, and any jobs in Chemistry seemed disinteresting to me now. I had become friends with some Data Scientists and Webdevs in DC, and would tell them about how I was looking for a career change. I had dabbled in some free, online courses, but it was when they invited me to meetups, was where I quickly fell in love with the culture. People there literally LOVED what they were doing and creating, and they wanted to share that with everyone. I couldn't fathom feeling and getting that much satisfaction out of my job. I wanted in. I started looking into bootcamps and poured myself into Flatiron's intensive bootcamp prep. It was fun and I didn't mind spending my free time working. 

From there, the rest is history. I applied to Flatiron and anxiously awaited to hear. Upon being accepted, and awarded the Women Take Tech Scholarship, my choice was easy. This program has been a rewarding and exciting experience, even if I have days I want to pull my hair out. The analytical thought process that I had developed while earning my degree has helped me immensely while working through this course. It makes me feel slightly better about that expensive piece of paper (my diploma), not entirely going to waste.

Because I am doing the course part-time, while working a full-time schedule as well, my goals are to finish in Spring/Summer of 2019 and begin the search for work in a field I can finally build a career out of!
